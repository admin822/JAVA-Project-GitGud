1. what is a minimum cost spanning tree(MST)? For a weighted undirected graph, if we can get a spanning tree that has the minimum cost(cost equals to the summation of each edge's weight in the spanning tree). Then this tree is called MST.
2. for a N vertex spanning tree, there are N-1 edges. 
3. The spanning tree will have to include all vertex in the graph.
4. people often use prim and kruskal to generate MST.
5. It doesn't matter which vertex you start the Prim algorithm with, the final cost will always be the same.
