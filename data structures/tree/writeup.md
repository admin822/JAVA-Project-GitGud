**why** we need tree structure? because using tree we can have a relatively optimized speed in both searching and changing.

# Binary Tree

1. if all leaf nodes are located at the highest level, we call this b-tree a **full binary tree**
2. A **complete binary** tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible
